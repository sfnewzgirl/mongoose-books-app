## Reflections
I found this exercise very helpful and informative. It really helps to walk through the steps, piece by piece. It helped having how each piece changes and interacts laid out. For example, starting with an array then a database then associations. Really helpful. I was able to walk through this and even did the challenges for 1 and 2. I think the one sticking point I ran into was doing the branch for sprint 2, i'm not sure i did that correctly. I have questions, but I understood what was going on.     

## Pre-requisites

* express
* intro to mongoose
* jQuery and AJAX

## Base Challenges - Build an App using mongoDB and mongoose

We're going to take this app piece by piece over the next day or so and build it up.

At first it's going to be a list of **books**.  Later we'll add in **authors** and embed **character** data in each book.
